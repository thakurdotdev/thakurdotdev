Hi, I'm Pankaj Thakur

Software dev by profession.  
Full-time debugger. Part-time philosopher.  
Just out here dodging meetings and merge conflicts.

What I do:
- Build stuff with React, React Native, Node.js
- Break stuff with TypeScript (on purpose, mostly)
- Talk to servers via WebSockets like it’s therapy
- Pretend to understand Docker
- Occasionally tame WebRTC demons

Current status:
Recently graduated from "intern who Googles everything"  
to "dev who still Googles everything (but faster)."

If it works, it ships. If it doesn’t... we’ll circle back (aka ignore it for now).
